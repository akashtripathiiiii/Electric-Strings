**Tentacle Animation**

The "Tentacle Animation" is an interactive JavaScript animation built using the HTML5 canvas element. This mesmerizing animation features multiple tentacles that elegantly follow the movement of the user's mouse cursor or autonomously move when the mouse is inactive. The animation is visually appealing with vibrant colors and realistic tentacle motion.

**Key Features:**

- Smooth and responsive animation powered by `requestAnimationFrame` for optimal performance.
- Tentacles adapt to follow the user's mouse cursor or exhibit autonomous movement when the mouse is inactive.
- Each tentacle is composed of interconnected segments that dynamically adjust their positions for natural motion.
- Colorful stroke effects and circular points enhance the visual appeal of the animation.
- Supports dynamic resizing to maintain responsiveness when the window size changes.

**Usage:**

1. Include the provided JavaScript code in your HTML file.
2. Create a canvas element with a unique ID (e.g., `<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>`).
3. Customize animation parameters (optional) such as the number of tentacles, their lengths, and colors.
4. Open the HTML file in a modern web browser that supports the HTML5 canvas element and JavaScript ES6 features.
5. The animation will start automatically upon page load, and the tentacles will react to mouse movements and clicks.

**Customization:**

Feel free to adjust various parameters in the code to suit your project's aesthetics:

- `maxl` and `minl`: Define the maximum and minimum lengths for the tentacles.
- `n`: Set the number of segments per tentacle.
- `numt`: Control the number of tentacles in the animation.
- Adjust colors, stroke styles, and line widths to create different visual effects.

**Browser Compatibility:**

The "Tentacle Animation" is compatible with modern web browsers that support the HTML5 canvas element and JavaScript ES6 features.
